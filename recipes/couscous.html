<h2>A nice dish that we call it in Morocco the Couscous</h2>
<p>In Morocco, what we call “couscous” is actually known as smida and refers to tiny balls of semolina flours made of durum wheat. This fundamental dish to Moroccan cuisine is cooked in large quantities and is commonly enjoyed on the national Moroccan holy day, Friday.</p>
